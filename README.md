Welcome to Music Maps Dashboard :musical_note:

:construction_worker_man: This project is currently a work in progress, and I'm actively building and improving it :construction_worker_woman:

## :hammer_and_wrench: Current Status

## :open_book: About the Project

The Music Maps Dashboard is a web application that uses the Spotify API to retrieve a user's music listening history and preferences. The app then maps the countries of the artists they listen to on to an interactive 3D globe using MusicBrainz's API. Users can visually explore their music tastes geographically and discover new insights about their favourite artists.

**Technology:**

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js

## :rocket: Planned Features

- :earth_africa: Display artists' countries on an interactive globe using 3D visualization
- :repeat: Real-time syncing of Spotify listening data with user authentication
- :bar_chart: Generate visual summaries of user listening habits, including top genres and most-listened-to regions
- :telescope: Explore artist details directly from the globe interface
- :file_folder: Enable user upload of their spotify stream history
